# Simulator
---
This repository holds different simulators for exploring and researching p2p networks and messaging related to Status.

Original intent of these simulators to provide stats and resulting traces/logs for further WebGL visualization.

See READMEs for each package/program separately.

## Propagation
Propagation simulators send message over known network topology and record its propagation data/stats.

Currently implemented:
 - Whisper V6 (based on geth code)
 - Naive p2p messaging (goroutines and channel simulation with naive simplistic message propagation, used for initial testing)

## Discovery
TBD
